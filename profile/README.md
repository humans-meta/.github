## NEARCON 2022 SUBMISSION
During this hackathon we implemented and fully open-sourced a Metaverse with UGC on top of NEAR Protocol:

🌈 [unity-renderer](https://github.com/humans-meta/unity-renderer) is a WebGL client, which interacts with NEAR via RPC and loads UGC assets

🍿 [near-content](https://github.com/humans-meta/near-content) is a sample repo of UGC about NEAR itself

🧙 [sef-near](https://github.com/humans-meta/sef-near) is a smart contract + frontend for adding and removing UGC

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
