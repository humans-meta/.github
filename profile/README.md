## NEARCON 2022 SUBMISSION
During this hackathon we tried to solve an educational problem: to help people learn more about Web3 technologies via interactive 3D visualizations. We used our experience in building interactive digital environments to create a free and open source Metaverse with support for curated user-generated content implemented top of NEAR Protocol:

🌈 [unity-renderer](https://github.com/humans-meta/unity-renderer) is a WebGL client which utilizes META Assets via NEAR smart contract + Github: https://nearcon2022.humans.work

🧙 [sef-near](https://github.com/humans-meta/sef-near) is a smart contract + frontend for adding and removing META Assets: https://create.nearcon2022.humans.work
 
🍿 [near-content](https://github.com/humans-meta/near-content) is a sample repo of META Assets
